In this assignment, we will explore ways to predict the length of a Wikipedia article based on the first 100 tokens in the article. Such a model could be used to explore whether there are systematic biases in the types of articles that get more detail.

If you are working in another language, please make sure to clearly indicate which part of your code is running which section of the assignment and produce output that provides all necessary information. Submit your code, example outputs, and instructions for executing it.

Note: This assignment contains topics that are not covered at the time of release. Each section has information about which lectures and/or labs covered the relevant material. We are releasing it now so you can (1) start working on some parts early, and (2) know what will be in the assignment when you attend the relevant labs and lectures.
